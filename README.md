# Alternative-Language-Project
Language and Version: I chose Java as the programming language for this project. The version used is Java 8.
Why Java? 
Java is a versatile programming language that is widely used in academic and corporate settings, which is why I chose it. The choice was largely influenced by Java's support for object-oriented programming, large standard library, platform freedom, and robust ecosystem. Furthermore, Java is a great option for developing scalable and maintainable applications because to its well-developed tools and community support.Language FeaturesJava provides complete support for object-oriented programming concepts, including polymorphism, inheritance, and encapsulation. Basic Java notions like classes and objects enable the creation of modular, reusable code.
File Ingestion: To read data from files, Java offers classes like FileReader and BufferedReader. Ingesting data from a variety of file formats, including CSV, is made simple by these classes.
Java allows for the use of classic conditional statements, including if-else and switch-case, which enable control flow dependent on predefined criteria.
Java assignment statements adhere to a standard syntax and provide the assignment of values to variables through the use of the "=" operator.Java has several loop types, such as for, while, and do-while loops, which are useful for repeating running code based on predefined conditions or iterating across arrays and collections.
Subprograms (Methods/Functions): Java allows for the modularization and reuse of code by enabling the introduction of methods (functions) within classes. It is possible to build a variety of algorithms and functionality with methods by using parameters and return types.
Unit Testing: JUnit and other libraries are available for Java. Writing and running unit tests using JUnit is a popular way to make sure Java code is accurate.
Exception managing: Try-catch blocks are Java's native means of managing exceptions. Exceptions can be sent to higher levels of the program, handled, or captured.Libraries UsedJUnit: For unit testing, I used JUnit. JUnit makes developing and running Java unit tests easier while guaranteeing the accuracy and dependability of the codebase.
Apache Commons CSV: This Java library allows you to interact with CSV files. The simplicity and user-friendliness of this library in reading and producing CSV data is why I picked it.
Gson: To convert Java objects to JSON and vice versa, use the Gson Java library. I serialized and deserialized objects using Gson, particularly when communicating with external APIs or data sources that employ the JSON format.Thw year with the highest number of phone launches after 1999.
